# gracenode 2.0

Â©Nobuyori Takahashi < voltrue2@yahoo.com >

## What gracenode does

- Manages cluster process.

- Handles daemonizing of the application and auto-restarting on file changes.

- Bootstrap other modules to organize setting up of each module on starting of the application process.

- Provides a built-in logging module.

- Provides plethora of utility functions to aid development.

## Installation via npm

**NOTE:** If you are running your application as a daemon with older version of gracenode, please make sure to stop the daemon before installing the newer version.

`npm install gracenode`

## Add gracenode as your application's dependency

To install gracenode you can either add it to your package.json like so:

**Install From Git Repository**
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "gracenode": "git+https://github.com/voltrue2/gracenode.git#master"
    }
}
```

**Install From npm Repositiory**
```json
{
    "dependeicies": {
        "gracenode": "0.2.2"
    }
}
```

**Install From Git Without package.json**

`npm install git+https://github.com/voltrue2/gracenode.git#master`

## How To Use gracenode

In order to use gracenode, you need to properly set it up in your application root file (The file that starts your application).

### Configure Logging and Cluster Management

These are optional configurations, but you will want to know what they do.

```javascript
var gn = require('gracenode');

// Here the configurations are given as an object
gn.configure({
	log: {
		file: '/path/to/my/logging/dir/'
	},
	cluster: {
		// Maximum number of workers
		max: 0
	}
});

// Now start gracenode
gn.start(function () {
	// Your application is now ready!
});

```

**NOTE 1:** You may give the configurations as a JSON file also:

```javascript
gn.config(require('/path/to/my/config.json'));
```

**NOTE 2:** You may call `.config()` as many times a syou need to merge the configuration objects.

This is useful when you have shared common configurtions with other developers and your custom configrations for each.

#### Example:

```javascript
gn.config(require('/path/to/my/shared/config.json'));
gn.config(require('/path/to/my/custom/config.json'));
```

**NOTE 3:** More details for logging and cluster configurations will be given later in this `README`.

## Start Your Application As A Daemon

There are 2 different ways to start your application as a daemon.

#### Example 1:

Assuming `app.js` is your appliction file to execute.

`node app.js start -l /path/to/my/daemon/logging/`

#### Example 2:

gracenode creates `./gracenode` executable when you install gracenode.

Assuming `app.js` is your appliction file to execute.

`./gracenode app.js start -l /path/to/my/daemon/logging/`

**NOTE:** More details on the daemonization command options will be explain later in this `REAME`.

## Auto-Restarting Of Daemon Process

It is very useful when you are developing your application to automatically restart the running daemon on changes that your make.

To do so, you need to use a daemon command option `-w`.

#### Example:

`node app.js start -l /path/to/my/daemon/logging/ -w /path/to/my/app/code/ /path/to/my/another/ap/code`

**NOTE:** `-w` option watches the directories/files that are given and when there changes such as adding a new file, removing some files, and changing the existing file are detected,
daemon will automatically restart so that your changes are now in effect without having to manually restart your daemon.

## Bootstrapping other modules

Some modules require some setting up before they can be used in your code, some setup process maybe asynchronous and your application has to wait for it to complete its process.
When you use such modules, simply calling `var mod = require('great-mod');` is not good enough especially when the module requires asynchronous setup.

**gracenode** can bootstrap all of these modules and handle setting up of each module in an organized way.

For example, assuming this `foo` module needs to read some files before it is ready, **gracenode** can handle it like so:

```javascript
var gn = require('gracenode');

gn.use('foo', 'node_modules/foo', {
	setup: function (cb) {
		this.readFromFiles(cb);
	}
});

gn.start({
	// Now gracenode is ready
	// and foo is also ready
	// to access foo module:
	gn.mod.foo.doSomething();
});
```

**NOTE 1:** The 2nd argument of `.use()` is a relative path to load the module `foo`. The path is relative to the root path of your application.

**NOTE 2:** The 3rd argument is an optional object that you can assign specific functions to perform setting and/or cleaning.

**NOTE 3:** `this` inside of the functions you assign to the 3rd argument is the module you are "using". In this example, `this` is `foo` module.
